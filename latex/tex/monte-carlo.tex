\chapter{Survey of Elementary Monte-Carlo Methods}%
\label{chap:mc}

As monte-carlo methods for multidimensional integration and sampling
of probability distributions are central tools of modern particle
physics, their basics shall be studied.  Some simple algorithms will
be implemented and applied to the results from~\ref{chap:qqgg}.
