\chapter{Survey of Elementary Monte Carlo Methods}%
\label{chap:mc}

Monte Carlo methods for multidimensional integration and sampling of
probability distributions are central tools of modern particle
physics. Therefore some simple methods and algorithms are being
studied and implemented here and will be applied to the results from
\cref{chap:qqgg,sec:compsher}. The \verb|python| code for the
implementation can be found as described in \cref{sec:source}. The
sampling and integration intervals, as well as other parameters have
been chosen as in \cref{sec:compsher} been chosen, so that
\result{xs/python/eta} and \result{xs/python/ecm}\!.
