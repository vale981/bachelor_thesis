\chapter{Survey of elementary Monte-Carlo Methods}%
\label{chap:mc}

Monte-carlo methods for multidimensional integration and sampling of
probability distributions are central tools of modern particle
physics. Therefore some simple methods and algorithms are being
studied and implemented here and will be applied to the results
from \cref{chap:qqgg}. The \verb|python| code for the implementation
can be found in \cref{sec:mcpy}.
