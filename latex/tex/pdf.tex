\chapter{The Hard Diphoton Process in Proton-Proton
  Scattering}%
\label{chap:pdf}

Because free quarks do not occur in nature, one has to study the
scattering of hadrons to obtain experimentally verifiable
results. Hadrons are usually modeled as consisting of multiple
\emph{partons} using Parton Density Functions (PDFs). By applying a
simple PDF, the cross section for the process \(\ppgg\) on the
matrix-element~\cite[14]{buckley:2011ge} level\footnote{Neglecting the
  remnants and other processes like parton showers, primordial
  transverse momentum and multiple interactions.} and event samples of
that process have been obtained. These results are once again be
compared with results from \sherpa.
