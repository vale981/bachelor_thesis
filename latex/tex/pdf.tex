\chapter{A Simple Model of Proton-Proton Collisions}%
\label{chap:pdf}

Because free quarks do not occur in nature, one has to study the
scattering of hadrons to obtain experimentally verifiable
results. Hadrons are usually modeled as consisting of multiple
\emph{partons} using Parton Density Functions (PDFs). By applying a
simple PDF, the cross section for the process \(\ppgg\) (neglecting
the remnants \(x\) and other processes) and event samples of that
process will be obtained. These results will once again be compared
with results from \sherpa.
