\chapter{The Hard Diphoton Process in Proton-Proton
  Scattering}%
\label{chap:pdf}

Because free quarks do not occur in nature, one has to study the
scattering of hadrons to obtain experimentally verifiable
results. Hadrons are usually modeled as consisting of multiple
\emph{partons} (i.e. quarks and gluons) using Parton Density Functions
(PDFs). By using a leading order PDF, the cross section for the
process \(\ppgg\) on the matrix-element level\footnote{Neglecting the
  remnants and other processes like parton showers, primordial
  transverse momentum and multiple interactions.}  and event samples
of that process are obtained~\cite[14]{buckley:2011ge}. These results
are being compared with results from \sherpa.
