\chapter{A Simple Model of Proton-Proton Collisions}%
\label{chap:pdf}

Because bare quarks do not occur in nature, one to study hadronic
scattering to obtain experimentally verifiable results. Hadrons are
usually modeled using Parton Density Functions (PDFs). Using a simple
PDF, the cross section for the process \(\ppgg\) (neglecting the
remnants \(x\) and other processes) and event samples of that process
will be obtained. These results will be compared with results from
\sherpa.
