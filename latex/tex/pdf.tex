\chapter{A Simple Model of Proton-Proton Collisions}%
\label{chap:pdf}

Because free quarks do not occur in nature, one has to study the
scattering of hadrons to obtain experimentally verifiable
results. Hadrons are usually modeled as consisting of multiple
\emph{partons} using Parton Density Functions (PDFs). By applying a
simple PDF, the cross section for the process
\(\ppgg\)\footnote{neglecting the remnants and other processes like
  parton showers, primordial transverse momentum and multiple
  interactions} and event samples of that process have been
obtained. These results are once again be compared with results from
\sherpa.
