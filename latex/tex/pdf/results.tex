\section{Implementation and Results}%
\label{sec:pdf_results}

The considerations of \cref{sec:pdf_basics,sec:lab_xs} can now be
applied to obtain a cross section and histograms of observables for
the scattering of two protons into two photons. Because the PDF is not
available in closed form, event generation is the only viable way to
obtain distributions of observables and verify theory against
experiment, even with this simple leading-order process.

The integrand in \cref{eq:pdf-xs} can be concertized into
\cref{eq:weighteddist}, where \(q\) runs over all quarks (except the
top quark). The sum has been symmetized, otherwise a double sum with
\(q\) and \(\bar{q}\) would have been necessary. The choice of \(Q^2\)
is justified in \cref{sec:pdf_basics} and formulated in
\cref{eq:q2-explicit}.

\begin{gather}
  \label{eq:weighteddist}
  \frac{\dd[3]{\sigma}}{\dd{\eta}\dd{x_1}\dd{x_2}} =
  \sum_q \qty[f_q\qty(x_1;Q^2) f_{\bar{q}}\qty(x_2;Q^2) + f_q\qty(x_2;Q^2) f_{\bar{q}}\qty(x_1;Q^2)] \dv{\sigma(x_1,
    x_2, Z_q)}{\eta} \\
  \label{eq:q2-explicit}
  Q^2 = 2x_1x_2E_p^2
\end{gather}

The PDF set being used in the following has been fitted (and
developed) at leading order and is the central member of the PDF set

accessed through the \lhapdf\
library~\cite{NNPDF:2017pd}\cite{Buckley:2015lh}.

\subsection{Cross Section}%
\label{sec:ppxs}

The distribution \cref{eq:weighteddist} can now be integrated to
obtain a total cross-section as described in \cref{sec:mcint}.  For
the numeric analysis a proton beam energy of
\result{xs/python/pdf/e_proton} has been chosen, in accordance to
\lhc{} beam energies. As for the cuts, \result{xs/python/pdf/eta} and
\result{xs/python/pdf/min_pT} have been set.  Integrating
\cref{eq:weighteddist} with respect to those cuts using \vegas\ yields
\result{xs/python/pdf/my_sigma} which is compatible with
\result{xs/python/pdf/sherpa_sigma}, the value \sherpa\ gives.

\subsection{Event Generation and Histograms}%
\label{sec:ppevents}

Generating events of \(\ppgg\) is very similar in principle to
sampling partonic cross section. As before, the range of the \(\eta\)
parameter has to be constrained to obtain physical results. Because
the absolute values of the pseudo rapidities of the two final state
photons are not equal in the lab frame, the shape of the
integration/sampling volume differs from a simple hypercube
\(\Omega\). Furthermore, for the massless limit to be applicable the
center of mass energy of the partonic system must be much greater than
the quark masses. This can be implemented by demanding the transverse
momentum \(p_T\) of a final state photon to be greater than
approximately~\SI{20}{\giga\electronvolt}. A restriction (cut) on
\(p_T\) is suitable because detectors are usually only sensitive above
a certain \(p_T\) threshold and the final state particles have to be
isolated from the beams.

The resulting distribution (without cuts) is depicted in
\cref{fig:dist-pdf} for fixed \(x_2\) and in
\cref{fig:dist-pdf-fixed-eta} for fixed \(\eta\). For \(x_1 = x_2\)
the distribution retains some likeness with the partonic distribution
(see \cref{fig:xs-int-eta}) but gets suppressed for greater values of
\(x_1\). The overall shape of the distribution is clearly highly
sub-optimal for hit-or-miss sampling, only having significant values
when \(x_1\) or \(x_2\) are small (\cref{fig:dist-pdf-fixed-eta}) and
being very steep.

    \centering \plot{pdf/dist3d_x2_const}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{\label{fig:dist-pdf-3d}Differential cross section
    convolved with PDFs with one parameter fixed.}
\end{figure}

To remedy that, one has to use a more efficient sampling algorithm
(\vegas) or impose very restrictive cuts. The self-coded
implementation used here can be found in \cref{sec:pycode} and employs
stratified sampling (as discussed in \cref{sec:stratsamp-real}) and
the hit-or-miss method. Because the stratified sampling requires very
accurate upper bounds, they have been overestimated by
\result{xs/python/pdf/overesimate}, which lowers the efficiency
slightly but reduces bias. % TODO: accuracy of integral in hypercubes

A sample of \result{xs/python/pdf/sample_size} events has been
generated both in \sherpa\ and through own code. The resulting
histograms of some observables are depicted in
\cref{fig:pdf-histos}. The sampling efficiency achieved was
\result{xs/python/pdf/samp_eff} using a total of
\result{xs/python/pdf/num_increments} hypercubes.  As can be seen, the
distributions are compatible with each other. The sherpa runcard
utilized here and the analysis used to produce the histograms can be
found in \cref{sec:ppruncard,sec:ppanalysis}. When comparing
\cref{fig:pdf-eta,fig:histeta} it becomes apparent, that the PDF has
substantial influence on the resulting distribution. Also the center
of momentum energy is not constant anymore and has a steep peak at low
energies due to the steepness of the PDF. The convolution with the pdf
has also smoothed out the jacobian peak seen in \cref{fig:histpt}.
