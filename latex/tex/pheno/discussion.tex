The results of the \sherpa\ runs for each stage with \(10^7\) events
each are depicted in the histograms in \cref{fig:holhistos} and shall
now be discussed in detail.
%TODO: high prec not possible
Because of the analysis cuts, the total number of accepted events is
smaller than the number of events generated by \sherpa, but sufficient
for proper statistics for most observables. The fiducial cross
sections of the different stages, which are compared in
\cref{fig:disc-xs}, differ as a result.
% TODO: not as result

All other histograms
are normalized to their respective cross sections.

Effects that give the photon system additional $\pt$ decrease the
cross section. This can be understood as follows. When there is no
additional \(\pt\), then the photon momenta are back to back in the
plane perpendicular to the beam axis (transverse plane). If the system
now gets a kick then this usually subtracts \(\pt\) from one of the
photons unless that kick is near perpendicular to the photons. Because
the \(\pt\) distribution (\cref{fig:disc-pT,fig:disc-pT_subl}) is very
steep, a lot of events produce photons with low \(\pt\) and so this
effect is substantial. The fraction of events that have been discarded
by the \(\eta\) and \(\pt\) cuts are plotted in
\cref{fig:disc-cut-disc}, which shows an increase for all stages after
\stone, leading (principally) to the drop in cross section for the
\sttwo\ and \stthree.

The isolation cuts do affect the cross section as well, as is
demonstrated in \cref{fig:disc-iso-disc} which shows the fraction of
events discarded due to the isolation cuts. The \stfour\ cross section
is a bit higher than the \stthree\ one, because the hardonization
favors isolation of photons by reducing the number of particles in the
final state and clustering them closer together. The opposite effect
can be seen with MI, where the number of final state particles is
increased and this effect leads to another substantial drop in the
cross section.

The transverse momentum of the photon system (see
\cref{fig:disc-total_pT}) now becomes non trivial, as both the \sttwo\
and \stthree\ stage affect this observable directly. Initial state
radiation generated by the parton showering algorithm kicks the quarks
involved in the hard process and thus generates transverse momentum
and primordial \(\pt\) is simulated by the \stthree\ stage. In regions
of high \(\pt\) all but the \stone\ stage are largely compatible,
falling off steeply at
\(\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\giga\electronvolt})\). In the region of
\SI{1}{\giga\electronvolt} and below, the effects primordial \(\pt\)
show as an enhancement in cross section. This is consistent with the
mean of the primordial \(\pt\) distribution which was off the order of
\gev{1}. The distribution for MI is enhanced at very low \(\pt\) which
could be an isolation effect or stem from the fact, that other partons
can emit QCD bremsstrahlung and showers as well, decreasing the
showering probability for the partons involved in the hard scattering.
% TODO: clarify, Frank
The fact that the distribution has a maximum and falls off towards
lower \(\pt\) relates to the fact, that parton shower algorithms
effectively sum over all terms of the perturbation series and is
nontrivial~\cite{buckley:2011ge}.

Related effects can be seen in the distribution for the azimuthal
separation of the photons in \cref{fig:disc-azimuthal_angle}. Albeit
back to back photons are favored by all distributions and most events
feature an azimuthal separation of less than \(\pi/2\), the
enhancement of the low \(\pt\) regions in the \stthree\ stage also
leads to an enhancement in the back-to-back region for this stage over
the \sttwo\ stage.

In the \(\pt\) distribution of the leading photon (see
\cref{fig:disc-pT}) the boost of the leading photon towards higher
\(\pt\) in all stages but the \stone\ originates from the parton
showering and thus the distribution of those stages are largely
compatible beyond \gev{1}. Again, the effect of primordial \(\pt\)
becomes visible transverse momenta smaller than \gev{1}.
% TODO: mention steepness again

The \(\pt\) distribution for the sub-leading photon shows remarkable
resemblance to the \stone\ distribution for all other stages, although
there is a very minute bias to lower \(\pt\). This is consistent with
the mechanism described above so that events that subtract (very small
amounts of) \(\pt\) from the sub-leading second photon are more
common. Interestingly, the effects of primordial \(\pt\) not very
visible.

The distribution for the invariant mass (see \cref{fig:disc-inv_m})
shows that events with lower c.m.\ energies than the \stone\ threshold
can pass the cuts by being \(\pt\) boosted. The decline of the cross
section towards lower energies is much steeper than the PDF-induced
decline towards higher energies. High \(\pt\) boost to \emph{both}
photons are very rare, which supports the reasoning about the drop in
total cross section. The tendency for higher \(\pt\) boosts of the
photon system in the \sttwo\ stage shows in a slight enhancement of
the \sttwo\ cross section at low \(\pt > \gev{2}\).

The angular distributions of the leading photon in
\cref{fig:disc-cos_theta,fig:disc-eta} are most affected by the
differences in total cross section and slightly shifted towards more
central (transverse) regions for all stages from \sttwo\ on due to the
\(\pt\) kicks to the photon system.

Because the diphoton system itself is only affected by recoil to the
initial state quarks, the scattering angle cross sections in
\cref{fig:disc-o_angle,fig:disc-o_angle_cs} show a similar shape in
all stages. Towards small scattering angles, the differences in shape
grow larger, as this is the region where the cuts have the largest
effect. In the CS frame, the cross section does not converge to zero
for \sttwo\ and subsequent stages. With non-zero \(\pt\) of the photon
system, the z-axis of the CS frame rotates out of the region that is
affected by cuts. The ration plot also shows, that the region where
cross section distributions are similar in shape extends further. In
the CS frame effects of the non-zero \(\pt\) of the photon system are
(somewhat weakly) suppressed.

It becomes clear, that the \sttwo\ and \stthree\ have the biggest
effect on the shape of observables, as they affect kinematics
directly. Isolation effects show most with the \stfour\ and especially
the \stfive\ stages. In angular observables hard process alone gives a
reasonably good qualitative picture, but in most other observables
non-LO effects introduce considerable deviations and have to be taken
into account.
