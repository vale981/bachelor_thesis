The results of the \sherpa\ runs for each stage with \(10^6\) events
each are depicted in the histograms in \cref{fig:holhistos} and shall
now be discussed in detail.

Because of the analysis cuts, the total number of accepted events is
smaller than the number of events generated by \sherpa, but sufficient
as can be seen. The fiducial cross sections of the different stages,
which are compared in \cref{fig:disc-xs}, differ as a result of
that. All other histograms are normalized to their respective cross
sections.

Effects that give the photon system additional $\pt$ decrease the
cross section. This can be understood as follows. When there is no
additional \(\pt\), then the photon momenta are back to back in the
plane perpendicular to the beam axis. If the system now gets a kick
then this usually subtracts \(\pt\) from one of the photons unless
that kick is perpendicular to the photons. Because the \(\pt\)
distribution (\cref{fig:disc-pT,fig:disc-pT_subl}) is very steep, a
lot of events produce photons with low \(\pt\) and so this effect is
substantial. The isolation cuts do affect the cross section as well
The \stfour\ cross section is a bit higher than the \stthree\ one,
because the harmonization favors isolation of photons by reducing the
number of particles in the final state. The opposite effect can be
seen with MI, where the number of final state particles is increased.

The transverse momentum of the photon system (see
\cref{fig:disc-total_pT}) now becomes non trivial, as both the \sttwo\
and \stthree stage affect this observable directly. Initial state
radiation generated by the parton showering algorithm kicks the quarks
involved in the hard process and thus generates transverse
momentum. In regions of high \(\pt\) all but the \stone\ stage are
largely compatible, falling off steeply at
\(\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\giga\electronvolt})\). In the region of
\SI{1}{\giga\electronvolt} and below, the effects primordial \(\pt\)
show as an enhancement in cross section. This is consistent with the
mean of the primordial \(\pt\) distribution which was off the order of
\gev{1}. The distribution for MI is enhanced at very low \(\pt\) which
could be an isolation effect or stem from the fact, that other partons
can be showers as well decreasing the showering probability for the
partons involved in the hard scattering.
% TODO: clarify, Frank
The fact that the distribution has a maximum and falls off towards
lower \(\pt\) relates to the fact, that parton shower algorithms
effectively sum over all terms of the perturbation series and is
nontrivial~\cite{buckley:2011ge}.

Related effects can be seen in the distribution for the azimuthal
separation of the photons in \cref{fig:disc-azimuthal_angle}. Albeit
back to back photons are favored by all distributions and most events
feature an azimuthal separation of less than \(\pi/2\), the
enhancement of the low \(\pt\) regions in the \stthree\ stage also
leads to an enhancement in the back-to-back region for this stage over
the \stone\ stage.

In the \(\pt\) distribution of the leading photon (see
\cref{fig:disc-pT}) the boost of the leading photon towards higher
\(\pT\) in all stages but the \stone\ originates from the parton
showering and thus the distribution of those stages are largely
compatible beyond \gev{1}. Again, the effect of primordial \(\pt\)
becomes visible transverse momenta smaller than \gev{1}.
% TODO: mention steepness again

The \(\pt\) distribution for the subleading photon shows remarkable
resemblance to the \stone\ distribution for all other stages, although
there is a very minute bias to lower \(\pt\). This is consistent with
the mechanism described above so that events that subtract \(\pt\)
from the subleasing second photon are favored. Interestingly, the
effects of primordial \(\pt\) not very visible at all.

The distribution for the invariant mass (see \cref{fig:disc-inv_m})
shows that events with lower c.m.\ energies than in the \stone\ can
pass the cuts by being \(\pt\) boosted although. The decline of the
cross section towards lower energies is much steeper than the decline
towards higher energies, which originates from the PDFs. The tendency
for higher \(\pT\) boosts of the photon system shows in a slight
enhancement of the \sttwo cross section in the \sttwo\ cross section.

The angular distributions of the leading photon in
\cref{fig:disc-cos_theta,fig:disc-eta} are most affected by the
differences in total cross section and slightly shifted towards more
central (transverse) regions for all stages from \sttwo\ on due to the
\(\pt\) kicks to the photon system.

Because the diphoton process itself is only affected by kinematic
changes to the initial change quarks, the scattering angle cross
sections in \cref{fig:disc-o_angle,fig:disc-o_angle_cs} show a similar
shape in all stages. Towards small scattering angles, the differences
in shape grow larger, as this is the region where the cuts have the
largest effect. In the CS frame, the cross section does not converge
to zero for \sttwo\ and subsequent stages. With non-zero \(\pt\) of
the photon system, the z-axis of the CS frame rotates out of the
region that is affected by cuts. The ration plot also shows, that the
region where cross section distributions are similar in shape extends
further. In the CS frame effects of the non-zero \(\pt\) of the photon
system are (somewhat weakly) suppressed.

It becomes clear, that the \sttwo\ and \stthree\ have the biggest
effect on the shape of observables, as they affect kinematics
directly. Isolation effects show most with the \stfour\ and \stfive\
stages. In angular observables hard process alone seems to be a
reasonable good approximation, but in most other observables non-LO
effects introduce considerable deviations and have to be taken into
account.
