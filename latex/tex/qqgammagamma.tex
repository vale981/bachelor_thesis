\chapter{The Diphoton Process}%
\label{chap:qqgg}

Consider the scattering of quark and antiquark into two photons
\(\qqgg\), here called the diphoton process. In leading order this
process is being described by the Feynman diagrams in
\cref{fig:qqggfeyn}.  Because there is only QED involved, the color
degrees of freedom average out and will not be considered henceforth.
Furthermore a high energy regime will be supposed and therefore masses
will be neglected.
