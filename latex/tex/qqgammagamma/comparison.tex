\section{Discussion and Comparison with \sherpa}%
\label{sec:compsher}

The result obtained in~\ref{sec:qqggcalc} shall now be verified by
monte-carlo in \sherpa{}~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta}. To facilitate this, an
expression for the total cross section for a range of \(\theta\) or
\(\eta\) has to be obtained. Using the golden rule for
\(2\rightarrow 2\) processes and observing that the initial and final
momenta are equal (\(p_i=p_f\)) and \(g=\sqrt{4\pi\alpha}\), the
result~\eqref{eq:crossec} arises. The differential cross section is
also given in terms of the pseudo-rapidity in~\ref{eq:xs-eta}.

An additional factor of \(\frac{1}{2}\) comes in due to there being
two identical photons in the final state.
\begin{align}
  \dv{\sigma}{\Omega} &=
                        \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{(8\pi)^2}\cdot\frac{\abs{\mathcal{M}}^2}{\ecm^2}\cdot\frac{\abs{p_f}}{\abs{p_i}}
                        =
                        \underbrace{\frac{\alpha^2Z^4}{6\ecm^2}}_{\mathfrak{C}}\frac{1+\cos^2(\theta)}{\sin^2(\theta)}\label{eq:crossec}
  \\
  \dv{\sigma}{\eta} &= 2\pi\cdot\frac{\alpha^2Z^4}{6\ecm^2}\cdot\qty(\tanh(\eta)^2 + 1)\label{eq:xs-eta}
\end{align}

The differential cross section~\eqref{eq:crossec} (see
also~\ref{fig:diffxs}) is divergent for angles near zero or
\(\pi\). Allowing finite mass in the calculation may regularize this
divergence. Because \(m=0\) is the limit for
\(\ecm\rightarrow\infty\), the cross section would still have strong
peaks for angles near \(0,\pi\) at high energies so that the result is
not altogether nonphysical. The divergence of the cross section itself
is also not, the problem here, because it can be transformed into a
form where the divergence does not occur (see~\eqref{eq:xs-eta}).

The differential cross section is clearly symmetric around
\(\theta=\frac{pi}{2}\) as was to be expected, because the photons are
indistinguishable. To compare the cross section to experiment and to
simulation an interval around \(\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}\) has to be
chosen, where the first order, mass-less approximation may yield a
useful result.

The total cross section in such an interval, given by
integrating~\eqref{eq:crossec} for \(\theta\in [\theta_1, \theta_2]\)
or \(\eta\in [\eta_1, \eta_2]\) is given
in~\eqref{eq:total-crossec}.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:total-crossec}
  \begin{split}
  \sigma &=
  2\pi\mathfrak{C}\cdot\qty{\cos(\theta_2)-\cos(\theta_1)+2\qty[\artanh(\cos(\theta_1))
    - \artanh(\cos(\theta_2))]} \\
  &=2\pi\mathfrak{C}\cdot\qty[\tanh(\eta_2) - \tanh(\eta_1) + 2(\eta_1
  - \eta_2))] \\
  &={\frac{\pi\alpha^2Z^4}{3\ecm^2}}\cdot\qty[\tanh(\eta_2) - \tanh(\eta_1) + 2(\eta_1
  - \eta_2))]
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

As can be seen in~\ref{fig:totxs}, the cross section, integrated over
an interval of \([-\eta, \eta]\), is dominated by the linear
contributions in~\ref{eq:total-crossec} and would result in an
infinity if no cut on \(\eta\) would be made.  Choosing
\(\eta\in [-2.5,2.5]\) and \(\ecm=\SI{100}{\giga\electronvolt}\) the
process was monte carlo integrated in \sherpa\ using the runcard
in~\ref{sec:qqggruncard}. This runcard describes the exact same (first
order) process as the calculated cross section.

The monte carlo integration in \sherpa\ yields
\result{xs/sherpa_xs}. Plugging the same parameters
into~\eqref{eq:total-crossec} gives \result{xs/python/xs} which is within the
uncertainty range of the \sherpa\ value. This verifies the result for
the total cross section.
