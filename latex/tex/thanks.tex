\section*{Acknowledgements}

I want to thank Frank Siegert, my thesis advisor, for his patience
with which he endured my rapid fire of Skype messages and all the
helpful explanations with which he pulled me out of the odd mental
ditch.

I also want to thank Christian Wiel for proof reading my thesis and
giving me insightful hints. I am indepted to Falko Trojahn, who also
has proof-read with the perspective of an ``outsider''.
