Description:
  'A brief description of what is measured and what it is useful for
  in terms of MC testing, tuning, reinterpretation, etc. Use LaTeX
  for maths, e.g. $\pT > 50\;\GeV$.'
ValidationInfo:
  'A description of the process used to validate the Rivet code against
  the original experimental analysis. Cut-flow tables and similar information
  are welcome'
#ReleaseTests:
# - $A my-hepmc-prefix :MODE=some_rivet_flag
Keywords: []
ToDo:
 - Implement the analysis, test it, remove this ToDo, and mark as VALIDATED :-)
 - add more documentation in here
