What the heck should be in there. Let's do an outline.

* Intro
** Importance of MC Methods :SHORT:
 - important tool in particle physics
   - not just numerical
 - somewhat romenatic: distilling information with entropy
 - validation of new theories
   - some predictions are often more subtle than just the existense of
     new particles
   - backgrounds have to be substracted
