What the heck should be in there. Let's draft up an outline.

* Intro
** Importance of MC Methods :SHORT:
 - important tool in particle physics
   - not just numerical
 - somewhat romenatic: distilling information with entropy
 - validation of new theories
   - some predictions are often more subtle than just the existense of
     new particles
   - backgrounds have to be substracted
** Diphoton Process
 - feynman diags and reaction formula
 - higgs decay channel
 - dihiggs decay
 - pure QED
* Calculation of the XS :TOO_LONG:
** Approach
 - formalism well separated from underlying theory
   - but can fool intuition (spin arguments)
   - in the course of semester: learned more about the theory :)
 - translating feynman diagrams to abstract matrix elements straight
   forward
 - first try: casimir's trick
   - error in calculation + one identity unknown
 - second try: evaluating the matrices directly
   - discovered a lot of tricks
   - error prone
 - back to studying the formalism: completeness relation for real
   photons
   - a matter of algebraic gymnastics
   - boils down to some trace and dirac matrix gymnastics
   - mixing terms cancel out, not zero in themselves
 - resulting expression for ME essentially t/u channel propagator
   (1/(t*u)) and spin correlation 1 + cos(x)^2
 - only angular dependencies, no kinematics, "nice" factors
 - symmetric in Î¸
** Result + Sherpa
 - apply the golden rule for 2->2 processes
 - show plots and total xs
 - shape verified later -> we need sampling techniques first
* Monte Carlo Methods
 - one simple idea, can be exploited and refined
 - how to extract information from a totally unknown function
   - look at it -> random points are the most "symmetric" choice
   - statistics to the rescue
 - what does this have to do with minecraft
